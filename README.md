SUPERSTORE SALES POWER BI PROJECT SUMMARY 
Steps followed:
1)Data Cleaning:
• Imported the “Superstore” file from excel into Power BI using “Get data” 
button.
• Transformed the data on Power Query Editor.
• Removed all the null and empty values, changed the datatypes as per the 
data in columns.
• Split the address column into city, state, country, pin code.
2)Data Modelling:
• Created Dimension tables Products, Order Details and Customers from Orders table, 
fact table being Orders table.
• Removed duplicates from the Dimension tables.
• Established the one-to-many relationships between them with fact table in model 
view.
3)Data Analysis:
• Created a new column “Sales” for each quantity with price per each.
• Visualised it using card.
• Created another column “Cart Value” categorising the sales into Low, medium, high 
and very high.
• Created another column “Delivery days” to see difference between ordered and 
shipped dates.
• Calculated average number of days it takes to ship the goods.
• Calculated measures like “Low” category’s products with >= 50% discount, YTD sales, 
YoY growth, Discounted sales using appropriate DAX expressions.
• Visualised through pie, line, column charts and matrix visualisation.
• Applied Slicers as Years, so that for every visualisation, year wise analysis can be seen 
for more clarity.
4)Insights gained:
• Sum of sales grew by every year from 2014 to 2017.

Total Sales "Low"sales-50% Discount Peak sales month
Suggestions:
• Majority share of sales in from “Low” cart value, so business should target 
them and try to give more discounts to increase their sales.
• Every year end the sales peak, so it is best to leverage it.
• On an average the Delivery days is majorly 5, so try to shorten the period.
Conclusion:
 Finished the project by carefully implementing all the necessary steps, drawn 
some good and useful insights through visualisations and made reports.
